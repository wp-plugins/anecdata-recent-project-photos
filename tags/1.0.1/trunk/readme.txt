== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who are you? =

Anecdata is a project of the [Community Environmental Health Lab](http://mdibl.org/research/environmental-sustainability/cehl/) at the MDI Biological Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. You can contact us by email at `dbailey at mdibl dot org`.

We started building Anecdata because existing citizen science sites didn't have the versatility we needed for a lot of our projects, and we realized that many other organizations must be encountering the same problem.

= Can you add (feature X)? =
We always welcome feature suggestions! If you'd like a more bespoke approach, we would be happy to consult with you about integrating maps, graphs, galleries, or other data from Anecdata onto your website.

= I found a bug. Can you fix it? =
Sure! Drop a mesage in the support section and we'll give it our best!
